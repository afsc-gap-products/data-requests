# data-requests

This is a repository dedicated to use only for communication about data requests via GitHub issues. 

## Making a request
If you are interested in a data product, [submit it as an issue](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/data-requests/issues) to this repository. If possible, include the following information:

1. Data product requested (stratum CPUE, etc.)
2. Species
3. Region (GOA, AI, Bering Sea)
4. Time frame
5. Research team making the request (PI /requester name if you are not the PI, and tag team members with github accounts)

To better understand what data are available and how to interpret the data you receive, please review our [survey codebooks](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/groundfish-survey-species-code-manual-and-data-codes-manual).

## Credit for data and analysis
Adapted from Stan's [note](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/data-requests/issues/3) to the groundfish team:

The AFSC Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) staff produces important data for research and management of fishery resources and, as a result of these vast collections, we are often the recipients of data requests. Some of these data requests are routine and minor and don't take much time or effort. Other data requests can be large, require custom processing, and can take a great deal of time, effort, and skill. In all instances when GAP produced data is used, GAP and/or GAP employees should be acknowledged for the time and effort to produce the data. 

These acknowledgements can take a form of “thank you” note in informal documents or websites, to co-authorship or formal acknowledgements in scientific papers. **The form of acknowledgement should depend on the product GAP data was used for and on the GAP employee contribution (e.g. data only, data & data-products (graphs, tables, figures), data & interpretation or data and writing).** 

**GAP employees** are encouraged, when providing data products to others, to ask for appropriate acknowledgement at the time of acceptance of the data request. For example, you can include a note in the email stating: “I would appreciate acknowledgement of the hard work by the personnel of AFSC Groundfish Assessment Program needed to collect the data.”

The acknowledgement in the form of co-authorship requires significant contribution to the paper. If  you think coauthorship is appropriate to the request, make this request in your initial response to the data request. Support your request with information about your specific contribution. Stan cites Yale University's “Guidance on Authorship in Scholarly or Scientific Publications”:

>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for its content. All co-authors should have been directly involved in all three of >the following:
>
>1. Planning and contribution to some component (conception, design, conduct, analysis, or interpretation) of the work which led to the paper or interpreting at least a portion >of the results;
>
>2. Writing a draft of the article or revising it for intellectual content; and
>
>3. Final approval of the version to be published.  All authors should review and approve the manuscript before it is submitted for publication, at least as it pertains to their >roles in the project.


Each co-author is responsible for considering his or her role in the project and whether that role merits attribution of authorship. Co-authors should review and approve the manuscript, at least as it pertains to their roles in the project.

Discuss data requests with your supervisor and/or Program Manager and reach a decision on the effort required to complete data request. If you feel that it should earn you co-authorship, this should be negotiated with the data requester before you fulfill the data request and be part of your Performance Plan.
